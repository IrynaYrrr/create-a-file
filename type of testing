	•	Unit Testing – testing individual code modules.
	•	Integration Testing – verifying interactions between components.
	•	System Testing – testing the entire system as a whole.
	•	User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – ensuring the product meets customer expectations.

2. Non-Functional Testing

Evaluates system characteristics such as performance and security:
	•	Performance Testing – checking speed, load, and stability.
	•	Security Testing – identifying vulnerabilities in data protection.
	•	Usability Testing – analyzing the user-friendliness of the interface.
	•	Compatibility Testing – verifying operation across different devices and platforms.
